# Project openstack
Manual installation of openstack (ussuri version)


#For my undergraduate project, I decided to set up a private cloud based on openstack for the company where I did my internship. So this documentation has been produced. I used only virtual machines and this is only a simulation and should not be confused with a production deployment. 


All the documentation has been made with root rights, all commands starting with # must be executed either by using the sudo command (root)
