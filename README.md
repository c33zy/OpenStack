# Project openstack
Manual installation of openstack (ussuri version)


For my undergraduate project, I decided to set up a private cloud based on openstack for the company where I did my internship. So this documentation has been produced. I used only virtual machines and this is only a simulation and should not be confused with a production deployment. 


All the documentation has been made with root rights, all commands starting with # must be executed either by using the sudo command (root)

This installation will be carried out on 03 machines. A controller, a compute (to execute the instances) and a storage machine. I would like to remind that this is a minimal installation in a test environment to simulate the operation of the cloud.
